# Midterm Abalone Age Predictor
Midterm project

This midtermin project (Mo, 18.04.22 - Fr, 22.04.22) aims to show the learned knowledge from the past four weeks. 
In this 5th week Christin and I will work on a modelling task to be able to predict the age of abalones. 

Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. 

The used dataset was published by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository in 1995.  
It contains 4177 instances with 9 attributes. From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).
